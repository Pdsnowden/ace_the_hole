        <div class="faqTitle"><h1>Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h1></div>

    <div class="faqQuestion">What are the Rules?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer">We currently adhere to the USAT Rules for Triathlon
      &amp; Duathlon.  Important rules include no drafting, you must wear a helmet
      and music is ABSOLUTELY NOT allowed during the bike for obvious safety reasons.</div>

      <div class="faqQuestion">Can I use a personal music devise while cycling?</div>
      <div class="faqAnswer"> Absolutely no music devices are allowed during the
         bike segment for obvious safety risks and will result in immediate disqualification.</div>

    <div class="faqQuestion">Can I use a personal music devise while running?</div>
     <div class="faqAnswer"><p>During any running segments, we prefer for athletes
        to NOT use music devices to maximize safety, assure a fair competitive
        environment and assure athletes can hear all course marshal instructions.
         With that said, we also understand that many athletes rely on music to
         help endure the challenge of running. To accommodate the needs of our
         athletes while still assuring maximum safety and a fair, competitive
          environment, here is the arrangement that we can accommodate.</p>

        <p>If you chose to use a personal music device, you must always keep one
        ear open for instructions so only one ear-bud can be used at any time.
        In addition, if you opt to use music, you will not be eligible for awards,
         points and rankings. So as an athlete, you have to make a choice…music
         or awards/points/rankings.If you are using a personal music devise
         with two earbuds, you will be immediately disqualified. Trust us, we
         don’t want to have to enforce a disqualification but in order to assure
          the safety of all athletes, this is a very important rule. We also
          request that if you chose to use a personal music device that you keep
           the volume to a minimum to assure all instructions can be heard.</p></div>


      <div class="faqQuestion">Do I need to wear a wetsuit?</div>
      <div class="faqAnswer"><p>No, you do not need to wear a wetsuit. Many will
        not wear a wetsuit while others will choose to wear a wetsuit because of
         the buoyancy and warmth factor.<p></div>
      <div class="faqQuestion">Do I have to use a road or racing bike?</div>
       <div class="faqAnswer"><p>No. We welcome any type of bike as long as it is
          functioning properly with brakes and endcaps at the end of your handlebars.</p></div>
